# 📰 News Trends NLP Analysis

Analyzing **10 years of HuffPost headlines (2012–2022)** using NLP, sentiment analysis, and entity extraction techniques.

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores how topics, sentiment, and language trends have evolved in U.S. digital media over the past decade. Using the Huffington Post dataset, we performed:

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** with spaCy and NLTK
- **Sentiment Analysis** over time (positive, negative, neutral)
- **Co-occurrence Network Mapping** between key entities
- **Text Visualization** using line charts, bar plots, and heatmaps

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (spaCy, NLTK, Plotly, Matplotlib)
- Data Collection: BeautifulSoup, Selenium
- Data Cleaning: ftfy, Pandas
- Database formatting: SQLite
- Presentation: PowerPoint
